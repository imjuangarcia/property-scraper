# Property Scraper

A tool I created to scrape properties from all major real state platforms in Argentina, and show them using [this tool](https://github.com/imjuangarcia/property-locator).

Heads up that I don't use this tool anymore, since I've moved a while back. This repo isn't maintained anymore, and since it was last used, the markup from the real state sites might've changed. Feel free to give it a try and update if necessary!

## Installation and running the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/imjuangarcia/property-scraper/`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run main`

### Screenshots

This is a scraper, so it runs on the Terminal. So, nothing to show here! However, find below screenshots of the UI where [this scraper is used](https://github.com/imjuangarcia/property-locator):
